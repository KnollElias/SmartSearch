# SmartSearch - Advanced Search Engine for the Construction Industry

SmartSearch is an AI-powered search engine optimized for architects and construction professionals, developed at the AEC Hackathon Zurich Edition 2025 by the SmartSearch team. Built with sysTEAMatik, this project enhances search capabilities within construction workflows by leveraging LLMs, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and blueprint classification via image-pattern recognition. It enables keyword-based blueprint searches for efficient classification and retrieval while improving web search accuracy by refining query keywords for better contextual understanding. The system integrates a knowledge base to provide relevant references and documentation, ensuring optimal results. Developed as an open-source solution, SmartSearch is a step towards AI-enhanced information retrieval in the construction industry.

Developed by SmartSearch during the AEC Hackathon Zurich Edition 2025, based on a concept and project management by [sysTEAMatik](https://www.systeamatik.ch/), with development contributions from [Jonas](https://github.com/jghenriksson).
